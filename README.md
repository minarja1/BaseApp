# Base
A base project to all of my Android apps. Contains common code base you're probably gonna need in every Android app, i. e. BaseFragment, BaseViewModel, common extensions, Dependency Injection with Koin, SharedPrefs and more.

Add this to your app's build.gradle and code away!
```
 implementation 'com.github.minarja1:Base:v1.0.8'
